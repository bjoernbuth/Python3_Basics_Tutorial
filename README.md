# Python Exercises for Beginners

This is a tutorial for novice programmers. You are the learner I had in mind when writing these exercises if:

* you have no programming experience at all
* you have some experience with a different programming language like R, MATLAB or C.
* you would like to teach Python to others

Pick an exercise and start programming!
