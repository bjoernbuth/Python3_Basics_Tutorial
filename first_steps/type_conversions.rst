**Ada Lovelace** was the first human to write a computer program.
This was quite an achievement, given that Ada had to imagine a computer first!


In this chapter you will:

==== =================================
üöÄ   calculate the age of Ada Lovelace
‚öô    distinguish data types
üí°    use the data type ``float``
üí°    convert data types
üêû    recognize bugs at runtime
==== =================================


Exercise 1: Ada Lovelace
------------------------

Insert the following pieces into the gaps, so that all instructions are
executed correctly: ``age``, ``int(age)``, ``name``, ``str(born)``,
``1815``

.. code:: python3

   name = "Ada Lovelace"
   born = ...
   ...  = "37"

   text = ... + " was born in the year " + ... + "."
   year = born + ...
   print(text)
   print(year)

.. hint::

   Python contains many functions for **type conversion**.
   With the functions ``int()``, ``float()`` and ``str()`` you can convert
   numbers and strings into each other.


Exercise 2: Nine plus nine
--------------------------

Insert ``int()`` or ``str()`` into the instructions,
so that all of them run without an error.

.. code:: python3

   9 + 9
   9 + "9"
   "9" + "9"
   9 * "9"


Exercise 3: Output
------------------

Which ``print`` statements work?

.. code:: python3

   print("9" + "9")
   print "nine"
   print(str(9) + "nine")
   print(9 + 9)
   print(9 + int("9"))
   print(nine)
   print(float("9") + int(9.0))


Exercise 4: Debugging
---------------------

The following code should calculate the age of Ada in a year entered by
the user. It contains three bugs. Find and fix them.

.. code:: python3

   year_of_birth = 1815
   year = input('Which year is it? ')
   age = year_of_birth - year

   print("Today, Ada Lovelace would be " + age + " years old.")    


Exercise 5: Age Calculator
--------------------------

Write a program where you can enter the year in which you were born.
The program should calculate your age on January 1st of this year.

Use the following code to calculate the current year:

.. code:: python3

   import time

   time.time() // (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) + 1970

.. hint::

   ``time`` is a Python module. It contains useful functions.

   ``time.time()`` is a function in that module.
   It returns the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970
   (called the Unix Epoch, the 0 AD of computers).


Reflection Questions
--------------------

* which variable types have you seen so far?
* what does a type conversion function do?
* what is a ``TypeError``?
