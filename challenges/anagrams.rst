Anagrams
========

**ðŸŽ¯ Generate all anagrams of a word with 3-6 letters.**

For example, the string:

::

   ROT

has the anagrams (permutations of characters):

::

   TOR
   ORT
   TRO
   RTO
   OTR

Hints
-----

-  Look up the function ``itertools.permutations()``.
-  You may need an expression like ``''.join(["T", "O", "R"])``

Extra challenges
----------------

-  Get yourself a word list. Find anagrams that are real words.
-  Implement the algorithm to generate the anagrams yourself. Get
   informed about **dynamic programming**.
