# Greatest Common Denominator

**ðŸŽ¯ Implement the [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) to determine the greatest common denominator of two integers.**

## Tests

Use the following code to test your function:

    assert gcd(6, 3) == 3
    assert gcd(12, 8) == 4
    assert gcd(42, 12) == 6

## Hints:

Translate the [pseudocode from the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Implementations) into executable code and run it.
