Seven Peaks
-----------

You are looking for seven dwarven cities. They are under the highest
mountains, of course. As you scan the horizon, you can clearly see the
elevation of each mountain:

::

   310
   464
   618
   772
   926
   1080
   ...

A peak is any elevation with two lower numbers before and after it.
Every peak hosts one of the dwarven cities. You find the elevations in
:download:`mountains.csv`.

How high are the seven peaks added together?
