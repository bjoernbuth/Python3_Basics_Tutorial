Greatest Common Denominator
===========================

**ðŸŽ¯ Implement the** `Euclidean
Algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm>`__ **to
determine the greatest common denominator of two integers.**

Tests
-----

Use the following code to test your function:

.. code:: python3

   assert gcd(6, 3) == 3
   assert gcd(12, 8) == 4
   assert gcd(42, 12) == 6

Hints:
------

Translate the `pseudocode from the Wikipedia
page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Implementations>`__
into executable code and run it.
