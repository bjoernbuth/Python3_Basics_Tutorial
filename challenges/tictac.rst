Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

**ðŸŽ¯ Find out which player won.**

You are given a Tic-Tac-Toe playing field as a nested list:

::

   ttt = [['X', 'O', 'X'],
          ['.', 'X', 'O'],
          ['X', 'O', 'O']]

Write a program that determines which player has three symbols in a row
(or whether it is a draw).

Hints
-----

-  Examine rows, columns and diagonals separately at first.
-  It gets a little easier when you leave out the inner brackets.
-  Test the code with several game situations.
