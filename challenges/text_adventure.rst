Quest for the Dragon Egg
========================

**üéØ Implement a text adventure.**

The Story
---------

Far, far away, in an hardly accessible landscape, the mystic dragon egg
lies hidden.. Will you find the egg and awaken the life within?

-  the dragon egg can be found on a lonely clearing
-  to awaken the egg, you need a magic spell
-  the spell is only known to a mage
-  the mage lives in a tower behind the forest
-  in the forest lives a bear that doesn‚Äôt let anyone pass
-  the bear, however, loves honey. Fortunately there is a beekeeper nearby.

.. hint::

   I admit this is not the greatest plot ever written.
   If you have a better one, program it!

Requirements
------------

Write a game in which you can travel around between multiple rooms
(clearing, tower, forest etc.).

-  the world consists of at least four ‚Äòrooms‚Äô
-  every room has a description
-  you enter the room to which you want to go on the keyboard
-  when you find the egg, the game ends with a final message

The game is entirely text-based.

Example Output
--------------

::

   Find the Dragon Egg
   ===================

   You are in your home town,
   a little trading spot on the desert border.

   There are paths leading to: desert, forest

   Where do you want to go? desert


   You are in the desert. The sun is burning.

   There are paths leading to: home, clearing, forest

   Where do you want to go? clearing


   On a hidden clearing you discover the dragon egg.

   Your quest has been successful!

Step by Step
------------

Step 1: Create a project folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a new folder for this project
-  Create a Python file ``adventure.py``
-  Open the file in an editor

Step 2: The Basic Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the program produce a welcoming message. You could use an output
with multiple lines:

.. code:: python3

   print("""
   Find the Dragon Egg
   ===================

   Your quest starts.
   """)

At the end, the program congratulates the player to success:

.. code:: python3

   print("""
   On a hidden clearing you discover the dragon egg.

   Your quest has been successful!
   """)

During the project, you will insert more code between these two
instructions.

**Execute the program and make sure it works.**

Step 3: The Main Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most important structural element of most games is the **main
loop**. In each round of the loop you can enter a command. The game
should end once you reach the final destination.

At the beginning it is unknown how many instructions the player will
enter. Therefore the number of loops is unknown. In such situations a
**conditional loop** with ``while`` is a good choice.

First you need to define a variable that contains the current location.
In Python you can use the name of the room as a string:

.. code:: python3

   room = "hometown"

As soon as you reach the room *‚Äúclearing‚Äù*, the game ends. You can check
that in the condition of the ``while`` loop:

.. code:: python3

   while room != "clearing":
       print(f"You are in {room}")
       room = input("Where would you like to go? ")

**Execute the program and make sure you can finish the game.**

Step 4: Rooms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your game does not have any rooms yet, so it is hard to tell where you
are.

Write interesting descriptions of the rooms and print them by adding
``if`` instructions like the following to the main loop:

.. code:: python3

   if room == "hometown":
       print("""
       You are in your home town.
       A small trading spot at the desert border.
       """)

You can replace the ``print()`` statement from the previous step with
the ``if`` statement.

**Execute the program and make sure it works.**

Step 5: Data Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checking every room with a separate ``if`` statement is feasible if you
have 4 rooms. But imagine your game has 100 or more rooms ‚Äì the program
would become quite messy.

A better alternative is to **structure the room data**. We will use a
**dictionary** that contains descriptions of all rooms:

.. code:: python3

   descriptions = {
       "hometown": """You are in your home town...""",
       "desert": """...""",
   }

Define this dictionary at the beginning of the program. Now you can
replace all ``if`` statements by a single request to the dictionary. The
**key** is the ``room`` variable.

Add these commands to the ``while`` loop:

.. code:: python3

   print(descriptions[room])

and remove the ``if`` statements from step 4.

**Execute the program and make sure it works.**

Step 6: Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment the program is not checking whether a room you entered
really exists. If you enter a wrong room (or make a typo), the program
stops with an error message.

Let‚Äôs check the input to prevent that.

The following code matches the users input with the keys of the
dictionary ``descriptions``:

.. code:: python3

   target = input("Where do you want to go? ")
   if target in descriptions:
       room = target
   else:
       print("Stop! There is no such place.")

Find out where in the program these lines need to be inserted.

**Execute the program and make sure it works.**

Step 7: Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Until now you could teleport from one room to any other. That makes the
game a bit boring.

-  First, it is not clear which rooms you can go to.
-  Second, you could enter ‚Äúclearing‚Äù, and the game ends right away.

The game would be a lot more interesting if only some rooms were
connected. For that, we need a second dictionary that contains the
connections. Each entry points from one starting room to one or more
targets:

.. code:: python3

   paths = {
       "hometown": ["beekeeper", "forest"],
       "forest": ["hometown", "deser"],
       ...
   }

You need two entries to create paths in both directions. If you leave
one of them away, you also could create *one-way-streets*.

The paths for the current room could be displayed with the following
line:

.. code:: python3

   print(paths[room])

or somewhat more nicely with:

.. code:: python3

   print(", ".join(paths[room]))

If you would like to extend the plausibility check, so that only the
current paths are accessible, you need the following line:

.. code:: python3

   if target in paths[room]:
       ...

**Execute the program and make sure it works.**

Step 8: Puzzles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interesting adventure should also contain a few puzzles. Here is how
a puzzle could look like:

::

   Where would you like to go? forest

   There is a BEAR in the forest!!! You run away.

   ...

   Where would you like to go? beekeeper

   You buy a pot of honey at the beekeeper.

   ...

   Where would you like to go? forest

   You leave the honeypot to the bear and carefully sneak through.

How to implement such a puzzle?

First you need a **state variable** that you define before the main
loop, e.g.:

.. code:: python3

   honey = False

Second, you need to check in the main loop whether the state should
change, and then change it, e.g.:

.. code:: python3

   if room == "beekeeper" and not honey:
       print("You buy a pot of honey at the beekeeper.")
       honey = True

Finally you need to check the state variable in the main loop to allow
actions or prevent them:

.. code:: python3

   if target == "forest":
       if honey:
           print("You leave the honeypot to the bear and carefully sneak through.")
           honey = False  # you can use the honey only once
       else:
           print("There is a BEAR in the forest!!! You run away.")
           target = room   # player stays in the same place

Final Remarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not easy to place all statements in the right order. A good idea
is to run the program after each modification and to see what happens.

For sure you have many ideas what to include in your adventure.
