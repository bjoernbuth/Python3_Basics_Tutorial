**ðŸŽ¯ Use Python to complete the following task:**

The Cheops pyramid in Giza consists of 2.3 million stone blocks of 3 \*
3 \* 2 m edge length. It was built within 20 years. The four basic edges
of the pyramid are 130 m long, the pyramid is 147 m high.

Questions:
----------

-  How much time did a team of 10 workers have to bring a stone block to
   its destination?
-  How many layers were stacked on top of each other?
-  How many blocks are there in the bottom layer?

Assume that the Egyptian working day was 14 hours long and that 20000
construction workers were on the site at the same time.

   pyramid size.
